              An id is similar to your name (Tania Hannaford) while class may be
              more similar to a description of you (creative, kind, short,

        <p>
          When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class
          applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a
          style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a
          special URL to link directly to an element and it’s used by
          JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Best practices for using classes versus IDs in HTML and CSS revolve
          around their fundamental differences in uniqueness and application:

            <h2>IDs:</h2>
            <p>
              The id attribute in HTML assigns a unique identifier to a single
              HTML element. This identifier can be used to style the element
              with CSS, interact with it via JavaScript, or create internal
              links within a webpage. Since id values must be unique, they
              ensure that only one element on the page will be affected by the
              styles or scripts that reference it

                <strong>Uniqueness:</strong>
                <p>
                  An ID must be unique within a single HTML document. It should
                  only be used to identify a single, specific element.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Targeting Specific Elements:</strong>
                <p>
                  IDs are ideal for targeting a particular element for styling
                  or manipulation with JavaScript (e.g., main-navigation,
                  footer-contact). IDs can also be used for same-page links
                  (i.e. linking from top navigation to a part of the page
                  below), and sometimes for HTML form label/input tags to
                  correlate them together.

                <strong>CSS Specificity:</strong>
                <p>
                  IDs have higher specificity than classes, meaning their styles
                  will generally override class-based styles if there's a
                  conflict. This can sometimes lead to specificity issues if not
                  used carefully.

                <strong>JavaScript Interaction:</strong>
                <p>
                  IDs are frequently used as targets for JavaScript to
                  manipulate specific elements on the page.

              The class attribute in HTML assigns an element one or more class
              names. In contrast to the id attribute, which is restricted to one
              element per page, the same class name can be assigned to multiple
              elements. This allows us to style, select, or manipulate groups of
              elements collectively, making it ideal for applying the same style
              or functionality to multiple elements on a page. The syntax of

                <strong>Reusability:</strong>
                <p>
                  Classes are designed for applying the same styles or behaviors
                  to multiple elements across a webpage or even multiple pages.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flexibility:</strong>
                <p>
                  An element can have multiple classes, allowing for the
                  combination of different styles.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Naming Conventions:</strong>
                <p>
                  Use descriptive and semantic names that indicate the purpose
                  or appearance of the elements they style (e.g.,
                  button-primary, card-item). Consider methodologies like BEM
                  (Block, Element, Modifier) for larger projects to ensure
                  consistency and maintainability.

                <strong>CSS Specificity:</strong>
                <p>
                  Classes have lower specificity than IDs, making them easier to
                  override and manage in complex stylesheets.

                You have multiple elements that should share the same style
                (like buttons, cards, or text blocks).
              </li>
              <li>
                You’re applying the same JavaScript behavior to several elements
                (e.g., toggling visibility, animations).
              </li>
              <li>
                You want to keep your code clean and reusable by grouping

          <h2>General Best Practices:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Prioritize Classes: In general, favor using classes over IDs for
              styling whenever possible due to their reusability and lower
              specificity, which promotes more manageable CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reserve IDs for Unique Elements: Use IDs only when you need to
              uniquely identify a single element on a page, especially for
              structural elements or JavaScript interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              Semantic Naming: Whether using classes or IDs, employ clear,
              descriptive, and semantic names that reflect the content or
              function of the element, not just its visual appearance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid Overuse of IDs: Excessive use of IDs can lead to overly
              specific CSS that is difficult to maintain and override.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider Specificity: Be mindful of CSS specificity when combining
              classes and IDs to avoid unexpected styling conflicts.
