        <h2>1. Unblocking a simple problem:</h2>
        <p>
          I was blocked on what seemed like a simple problem. The instructions I
          had been given did not align with the resources provided, which
          created confusion and uncertainty about how to proceed. To resolve
          this, I looked through the supplied materials, compared them with the
          resources I knew should apply to the project, and then checked back in
          with the project manager for clarification. At first I felt quite
          confused, but once the issue was confirmed I felt validated that the
          challenge was not due to my misunderstanding, but rather an
          inconsistency in the handover. From this experience I learned that
          sometimes obstacles are not about my own ability or understanding, but
          instead about things that happened prior to me receiving the file, and
          it is important to recognise when the problem lies in process or
          communication rather than in myself.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Elegantly solving a problem:</h2>
        <p>
          I was faced with a problem that needed an elegant solution: camel case
          had to be installed, although at the time I did not even know what
          camel case was. To work through the issue, I used console logging to
          test my assumptions and turned to ChatGPT for guidance. Throughout the
          process I felt both lost and very smart at the same time — lost
          because I was learning something completely new, yet smart because I
          was able to apply the tools at my disposal effectively to reach a
          solution. From this experience I not only solved the immediate issue
          but also learned the difference between camel case and snake case,
          which gave me new knowledge I can apply in future coding tasks.

        <h2>3. Problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
            <p>
              I usually write pseudocode in my head, but through this course I
              have found it useful to make it part of my actual process.
              Formalising it on paper or screen helps clarify my logic and gives
              me a stronger foundation before I start coding.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something</strong>
            <p>
              Experimenting has always been my natural way of solving problems,
              and in fact, it is what led me to join this course in the first
              place. I feel confident in this approach as it encourages
              exploration, risk-taking, and learning through trial and error.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong>
            <p>
              I really enjoy the rubber ducky method and find it both fun and
              effective. I had heard of similar techniques before, such as
              children using worry dolls, and I see parallels with mental health
              strategies — speaking thoughts aloud can bring clarity and
              perspective. This process helps me untangle my ideas and reassess
              them in a more objective way
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
            <p>
              I am becoming more confident in reading error messages,
              particularly as the messages in Cursor are clear and easy to
              follow. Being able to identify the line and type of issue quickly
              has made debugging less intimidating and more approachable
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
            <p>
              Console.logging is new to me in the way we have been using it
              during the course. Although I am still building confidence, it is
              becoming clearer each time I use it, and I can already see how
              valuable it is for testing assumptions and tracking what my code
              is actually doing
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Googling</strong>
            <p>
              Googling has been the original problem-solving tool of my
              generation, and I have always been confident in using it. However,
              I am finding that it plays a different role now — rather than
              being my first step, it has become a secondary resource as I
              develop other strategies and engage with new tools
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
            <p>
              This is an area where I am least confident. At present, I tend not
              to ask my peers for help, preferring to try to resolve issues on
              my own. I recognise that this is a growth area for me, as
              collaboration could provide useful perspectives and solution
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
            <p>
              I feel somewhat confident in asking coaches for help, but usually
              only when I have a specific problem that I cannot resolve on my
              own. While I value their expertise, I often prefer to attempt
              other strategies first.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Improving process with reflection</strong>
            <p>
              Reflection comes naturally to me, often happening during “shower
              thoughts” or those moments of clarity that appear at 3am. I feel
              confident in this process, as it allows me to step back, evaluate
              what worked, and identify areas to improve in both my learning and
              problem-solving approach.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="full-width-text" style="background-color: #facc15">
        <h2>
          4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
          time?:
        </h2>
        <p>
          I recognise that I am most confident with self-directed
          problem-solving methods such as pseudocode, trying different
          approaches, reflecting, Googling, and reading error messages. I am
          also developing confidence with technical debugging tools like
          console.logging. However, I am least confident when it comes to
          collaborative methods such as asking peers or coaches for help. I
          often find myself reluctant to ask because I feel like I am
          interrupting or that I will be dismissed with unhelpful responses such
          as “just Google it” or having the problem repeated back to me.
          Unfortunately, these experiences with teachers and mentors in the past
          have reinforced my hesitation, making me feel that it is easier to
          struggle through on my own rather than seek support. If I do ask for
          help, it is usually because I have already exhausted all other options
          or because the issue feels urgent and critical. Reflecting on this, I
          recognise that I should not need to “validate” myself to justify
          asking for help. Moving forward, I would like to approach help-seeking
          differently by reframing it as a way to save time, gain new
          perspectives, and build collaborative learning, rather than as a
          weakness or an interruption.
