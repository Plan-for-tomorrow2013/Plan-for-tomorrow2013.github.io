        <p>
          HTML is the stage and the set pieces - the structure and layout. CSS
          is the lighting, costumes and colours - the things that make it
          pretty!. JavaScript is the director, instructing the actors (the page
          elements) when and how to move, respond, or change. It adds the
          interactivity that brings the performance to life.

        <p>
          Imagine you're hosting a dinner party. First you plan (grocery
          shopping, prep dishes in order): that’s control flow, the sequence of
          steps you follow. But if you're prepping multiple appetizers and need
          to chop carrots until they’re all done—that’s a loop: repeating a task
          (chopping) until a condition is met (all carrots are chopped). In
          JavaScript, control flow ensures things execute top‑to‑bottom, while
          loops allow repeating actions until a condition is fulfilled.
