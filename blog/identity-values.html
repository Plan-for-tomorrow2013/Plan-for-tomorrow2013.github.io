            <h2>
              1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
            </h2>
            <p>
              As I’ve grown older and taken on more responsibility—particularly
              as a parent—I’ve found myself making more ethical decisions, often
              shaped by a desire to model compassion and fairness for my
              children. One example that stands out was during my daughter’s
              fifth birthday, a milestone that holds particular cultural
              significance in New Zealand. In NZ, turning five is more than just
              a birthday—it marks a transition from kindergarten to primary
              school and is often celebrated with enthusiasm and pride.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time, we were living in Australia, where school starts more
              routinely at the beginning of the year. Wanting to give my
              daughter a celebration that reflected the importance of this
              moment, I organised a party and invited all the children in her
              class—including one child who had developed a reputation for
              picking on others. It didn’t sit right with me to exclude anyone,
              especially a child, no matter their behaviour. I believed then—and
              still do—that exclusion only reinforces the kind of isolation that
              often contributes to difficult behaviour in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the party, some of the other parents stopped speaking to me.
              They clearly disapproved of my decision to include that child. But
              from an ethical standpoint, I felt strongly that inclusion,
              empathy, and fairness were values I wanted to uphold, especially
              in front of my daughter. Excluding a five-year-old from a
              celebration because of their behaviour felt wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, I stand by my decision. It was more important to me
              that no child felt deliberately left out, and that my daughter saw
              an example of kindness, even when it's not popular. Ethics aren’t
              always comfortable—but they should always reflect the kind of
              world we’re trying to create.

            <h2>
              2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have
              influenced your values and identity.
            </h2>
            <p>
              I’ve never felt entirely comfortable with the word “culture.” It’s
              often tied to visible markers—skin colour, language, accents,
              traditions. I don’t fit neatly into those categories. I’m not
              visibly “other.” I don’t speak with a foreign accent outside of
              New Zealand. When a form asks me to tick “Pākehā,” or someone
              remarks on my Italian surname, I’m reminded again that my cultural
              identity feels vague, even fragmented.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I do have is a strong sense of values—perhaps stronger than a
              defined identity. Those values have been shaped largely by the
              people around me, particularly my mother and grandmother, whose
              influence continues to echo in my life—for better or worse. They
              taught me the importance of independence, resilience, and showing
              up for others even when it’s hard. I’ve carried those values into
              how I work, parent, and live.
            </p>
            <p>
              I value time. I value relationships. I value honesty. But I often
              find myself questioning the labels that come with identity. Am I
              where I “should” be at 43? According to whom? I’m a wife—often
              referred to as “Greg’s wife.” I’m a mother—“Nick and Jacquie’s
              mum.” I manage soccer, water polo, and synchronised swimming
              schedules like a full-time job. I run a business—but that, too, is
              complicated. I’ve ghostwritten for so long that sometimes I
              question when I’m speaking as myself, or on behalf of someone
              else. Even that has shaped how I understand authenticity.
            </p>
            <p>
              So while I may not point to a specific cultural heritage with a
              clear name or flag, I am deeply influenced by the roles I hold and
              the people I care for. My culture, if I have one, is stitched
              together from lived experience, inherited strength, and the quiet
              act of choosing what matters, every day.

            <h2>
              3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during
              your learning journey.
            </h2>
            <p>
              My top strengths are curiosity, love of learning, creativity,
              hope, and perspective. Together, they create a powerful foundation
              for any learning journey—especially one that requires independent
              thinking and self-direction, like flipped learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Curiosity drives me to ask questions, explore ideas, and dig
              deeper. It means I rarely accept surface-level explanations and am
              motivated to understand how and why things work. Paired with a
              love of learning, this ensures that I stay engaged, even when
              things get challenging. I genuinely enjoy the process of
              learning—not just the outcomes—and that makes a big difference
              when motivation dips.
            </p>
            <p>
              Creativity helps me approach problems in unique ways. I often find
              myself making unexpected connections between ideas or reframing
              problems so they make more sense to me. This is especially helpful
              when navigating complex or unfamiliar material, or when
              traditional learning methods don’t quite resonate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hope gives me the resilience to keep going. I believe that effort
              leads to progress, even when things feel difficult. It allows me
              to view setbacks as temporary and to stay focused on what I can do
              next. And perspective allows me to zoom out when needed—to see the
              bigger picture, to reflect on what matters, and to not get lost in
              the noise of comparison or pressure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, these strengths will support me not just in acquiring
              new knowledge, but in doing so with confidence, curiosity, and
              adaptability. They keep me open-minded, engaged, and
              optimistic—which is exactly the mindset I want to bring to my
              learning journey.
            </p>

            <h2>
              4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
              development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Some of my lesser strengths include gratitude, perseverance,
              forgiveness, and love. While these might not traditionally be seen
              as “limitations,” they do suggest areas where I may need to be
              more intentional in how I approach both learning and career
              development.
            </p>
            <p>
              For instance, lower perseverance can mean I’m more likely to lose
              momentum when I don’t see immediate results, especially in areas
              that don’t feel personally rewarding. I also recognise that if I’m
              not actively practicing gratitude or forgiveness—towards myself or
              others—it can impact how I process feedback or deal with setbacks.
              These are important areas for growth, especially in environments
              where progress isn’t always linear.
            </p>
            <p>
              That said, this journey isn’t about starting from scratch—it’s a
              side hustle, not my sole career path. In fact, it’s part of my
              third career, which gives me a different kind of advantage. I
              bring with me a broad range of life and professional experiences,
              along with the maturity to see things in context. I also know that
              “career development” doesn’t have to follow a single path or
              timeline. With roughly 22 years of potential professional
              contribution still ahead, I see this as a flexible opportunity to
              learn something new, build additional skills, and remain
              adaptable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, while I’m aware of the limitations, I think my realistic
              mindset—and the fact that I’m not putting pressure on this to be
              everything—means I can approach it with a healthy balance of
              ambition and perspective.

            <h2>
              5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively
              with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss
              strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
              your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and
              why.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Earlier in my career, my default response to tension or resistance
              when working with others was to simply walk away. If the
              conversation was difficult or draining, I’d disengage—physically
              or emotionally. But as a business owner, I’ve had to evolve. These
              days, I give myself space: I don’t answer the phone if I’m not
              ready, I vent privately (often in colourful language), and I allow
              myself the time to rewrite and reframe an email before sending it.
              These small rituals give me the space to respond thoughtfully
              rather than reactively.
            </p>
            <p>
              One practical strategy that has consistently worked for me is
              aligning people with their strengths—especially when collaboration
              is tense. For example, if someone is being difficult but excels in
              design, I’ll frame the task around that: “This really needs your
              design eye—look at this mess, it’s calling for your magic.” Is it
              a little manipulative? Maybe. Is it effective? Absolutely. It gets
              the work done, improves buy-in, and defuses friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I trace this strategy back to high school, where a teacher
              introduced us to Dr. Edward de Bono’s Six Thinking Hats method. It
              changed how I approach group dynamics. The Hats provide a common
              language for collaboration, reduce confrontation by focusing on
              one mode of thinking at a time, and encourage diversity of
              thought. It taught me that reframing tension as a thinking
              style—not a personality clash—can create room for productivity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back, I can see that walking away was really about
              avoiding conflict. Today, I aim to reduce tension through
              redirection, reframing, and giving space—both to myself and
              others. Moving forward, I’d like to be more deliberate about
              applying tools like De Bono’s Six Action Shoes, especially the
              Pink Slippers (human caring) and Purple Boots (appropriate
              authority), depending on what the situation calls for. These
              frameworks offer more than conflict avoidance—they offer a
              structured way to lead with empathy, purpose, and strategy.
