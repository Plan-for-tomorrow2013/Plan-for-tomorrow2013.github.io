        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence (EI) is generally understood as the ability to
          recognize, understand, and manage one’s own emotions, as well as to
          perceive and influence the emotions of others, encompassing both
          self-awareness and social awareness skills (Mayer et al., 2003;
          Goleman, 2001). It is considered distinct from cognitive intelligence
          (IQ) and personality traits, with research demonstrating that EI can
          predict important outcomes such as workplace performance, leadership
          effectiveness, and interpersonal relationships, even after controlling
          for IQ and personality factors (Cherniss et al., 2006). In workplace
          contexts, EI contributes to building effective communication,
          collaboration, and conflict management skills, thereby enhancing
          organisational performance and employee well-being (Mental Health
          America, n.d.). Moreover, EI can be cultivated through structured
          programs—often referred to as social and emotional learning
          (SEL)—which have been shown to improve social skills, academic
          achievement, and mental health outcomes in educational settings
          (Cherniss et al., 2006; Collaborative for Academic, Social, and
          Emotional Learning, 2005).

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) differs from intelligence quotient (IQ)
            in that EQ refers to the ability to recognise, understand, and
            manage one’s own emotions, as well as perceive and influence the
            emotions of others, supporting empathy, self-regulation, and
            effective relationship building (BetterUp, n.d.; Dovetail, n.d.). In
            contrast, IQ measures cognitive abilities such as logical reasoning,
            problem-solving, and analytical thinking, which are less focused on
            emotional and social contexts (BetterUp, n.d.; Dovetail, n.d.).
            While IQ can contribute to academic and technical performance, EQ
            plays a critical role in communication, conflict resolution, and
            overall interpersonal effectiveness (Dev Academy, n.d.; BetterUp,
            n.d.).

          <h2>
            The importance of Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset on learning
          </h2>
          <p>
            Emotional intelligence (EQ) is important because it enables
            individuals to recognise, understand, and manage their own emotions
            as well as the emotions of others, which is essential for effective
            communication, collaboration, and relationship-building (Wikipedia;
            MHA National). In contrast to IQ, which measures cognitive ability,
            EQ is linked to empathy, adaptability, and self-regulation, skills
            that are crucial for navigating social and professional environments
            (Dovetail; BetterUp). In the workplace, higher EQ supports
            leadership, teamwork, and conflict resolution, while also helping
            individuals cope with stress and change, ultimately contributing to
            both personal wellbeing and organisational success (MHA National;
            Student Handbook).
