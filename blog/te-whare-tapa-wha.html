              Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing
              developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective
              on health

        <h2>My Te Whare Tapa Whā</h2>
        <p>
          Dev Academy has a commitment to Te Tiriti O Waitangi and is working
          out how to honour and integrate its principles. We all live in
          Aotearoa and drawing on a wellbeing model grounded in Te Ao Māori
          makes sense. We teach the whole person at Dev Academy, and this
          holistic approach is aligned with that.

            <strong>Tinana (physical wellbeing)</strong>
            <p>
              Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your body
              grows, feels and moves, and how you care for it. Nourishing and
              strengthening your physical wellbeing helps you to cope with the
              ups and downs and life. Feeling physically well helps you feel
              mentally well. Some key things to take care of taha tinana are
              physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene.
            </p>

          <li>
            <strong>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</strong>
            <p>
              Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and
              feelings. It’s about how you feel, as well as how you communicate
              and think. Taking care of taha hinengaro is important for
              everyone, regardless of whether or not you’ve experienced mental
              illness or distress. The foods we eat can affect our mental
              health, physical activity can reduce symptoms of stress and
              anxiety, and learning how to manage stress before it gets
              overwhelming are all ways to support taha hinengaro
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</strong>
            <p>
              The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua
              is the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief
              in a higher power. For others, wairua is an internal connection to
              the universe or the sacred. There is no right or wrong way to
              think of or experience wairua, but it is an important part of your
              mental wellbeing. Spiritual wellbeing can be expressed through
              beliefs, values, traditions and practices that support
              self-awareness and identity. Taha wairua provides a sense of
              meaning and purpose as well as experiencing a sense of
              connectedness to self, whānau, community, nature and the sacred.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</strong>
            <p>
              Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you
              care about and who you share your life with. Whānau is about
              extended relationships – it’s not just your immediate relatives,
              it’s your friends, hoamahi (colleagues), community and the people
              you care about. Everyone has a place and a role to fulfil within
              their whānau, and whānau contributes to your individual wellbeing
              and identity. Spending time with whānau, doing things for them and
              getting involved gives you a feeling of purpose, connection and
              wellbeing. It benefits you and strengthens your whānau. As a core
              source of strength, support, security and identity, whānau plays a
              central role in your wellbeing.

            <strong>Whenua (land)</strong>
            <p>
              As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the
              land and the natural environment is strongly connected to your
              health and wellbeing. You can think about whenua as your place of
              belonging. For Māori, the whenua is a key part of identity.
              Connection to the land and to nature has been shown to improve
              mental and physical wellbeing.
