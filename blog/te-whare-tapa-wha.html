              <strong>Tinana (physical wellbeing)</strong>
              <p>
                Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your
                body grows, feels and moves, and how you care for it. Nourishing
                and strengthening your physical wellbeing helps you to cope with
                the ups and downs and life. Feeling physically well helps you
                feel mentally well. Some key things to take care of taha tinana
                are physical activity, healthy eating, and good sleep hygiene.

              <strong>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</strong>
              <p>
                Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and
                feelings. It’s about how you feel, as well as how you
                communicate and think. Taking care of taha hinengaro is
                important for everyone, regardless of whether or not you’ve
                experienced mental illness or distress. The foods we eat can
                affect our mental health, physical activity can reduce symptoms
                of stress and anxiety, and learning how to manage stress before
                it gets overwhelming are all ways to support taha hinengaro
              </p>

            <li>
              <strong>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</strong>
              <p>
                The way people view wairua can be very different. For some,
                wairua is the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having
                a belief in a higher power. For others, wairua is an internal
                connection to the universe or the sacred. There is no right or
                wrong way to think of or experience wairua, but it is an
                important part of your mental wellbeing. Spiritual wellbeing can
                be expressed through beliefs, values, traditions and practices
                that support self-awareness and identity. Taha wairua provides a
                sense of meaning and purpose as well as experiencing a sense of
                connectedness to self, whānau, community, nature and the sacred.

              <strong>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</strong>
              <p>
                Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you
                care about and who you share your life with. Whānau is about
                extended relationships – it’s not just your immediate relatives,
                it’s your friends, hoamahi (colleagues), community and the
                people you care about. Everyone has a place and a role to fulfil
                within their whānau, and whānau contributes to your individual
                wellbeing and identity. Spending time with whānau, doing things
                for them and getting involved gives you a feeling of purpose,
                connection and wellbeing. It benefits you and strengthens your
                whānau. As a core source of strength, support, security and
                identity, whānau plays a central role in your wellbeing.

              <strong>Whenua (land)</strong>
              <p>
                As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the
                land and the natural environment is strongly connected to your
                health and wellbeing. You can think about whenua as your place
                of belonging. For Māori, the whenua is a key part of identity.
                Connection to the land and to nature has been shown to improve
                mental and physical wellbeing.
